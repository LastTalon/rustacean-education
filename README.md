# Rustacean Education

**Rustacean Education** is a set of [Rust] practice exercises. The problems are
meant to be used as a learning exercise for myself and others. Hopefully they
can help you as well.

Each exercise will contain a `README` with instructions. If viewing the exercise
on GitHub, this should automatically display when viewing the directory.
